VOMLUME = db and wordpress VOLUMES live outside of docker and persist outside of their isntances, so website
can hold images and text and stuff without losing intra-session

first make VM w VirtualBox (with GUI, so not alpie, debian). Need to use VM because need to be root, can't on school machines.

TODO: 
0: both https://localhost and https://vboxuser.42.fr work
log into mariadb with both root and user. currently "mysql -uwordpress_user -p" works with no pass only
1. log in as admin (?) and make sure onyl admins can edit website, normal users can'text. 
2. make sure containers relaunch on kill or stop in VM on campus, at home they don'text
3. make sure FROM alpine:x.x.x.x is the start of each dockerfile, currently php-fpm used in wordpress
4. update rocky dependencies (docker volume inspect xxxx) is where this shows 



If starting from a new VM:
sudo apt install -y curl
sudo apt-get remove docker docker-engine docker.io containerd runc
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
sudo sh get-docker.sh
sudo mkdir -p /home/rocky/data/mariadb
sudo mkdir -p /home/rocky/data/wordpress
sudo make
