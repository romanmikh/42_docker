VOMLUME = db and wordpress VOLUMES live outside of docker and persist outside of their isntances, so website
can hold images and text and stuff without losing intra-session

first make VM w VirtualBox (with GUI, so not alpie, debian). Need to use VM because need to be root, can't on school machines.

TODO: 
1. make sure onyl admins can edit website, normal users can'text
2. make sure containers relaunch on kill or stop in VM on campus, at home they don'text
3. make sure FROM alpine:x.x.x.x is the start of each dockerfile, currently php-fpm used in wordpress
